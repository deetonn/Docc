# Docc :newspaper:
An example of client-server connections built from scratch. This project contains multi-threaded networking, login system, session ids to track who the server is talking to, requests sent in json format that are able to contain anything and complete freedom in adding new endpoints.

# Work in progress
This is currently implemented to be used locally, it also does not encrypt packets being sent across sockets and it's mega scuffed. It will eventually be good though.
